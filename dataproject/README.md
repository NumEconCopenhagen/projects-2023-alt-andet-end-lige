# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Housing Prices and unemployment rates** and investigates if there is a relationship between the unemployment rate and the houseprices in a province. .

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. EJ55 (*Danmarks Statisik*) 
1. AUS08 (*Danmarks Statisik*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
``pip install binsreg``
