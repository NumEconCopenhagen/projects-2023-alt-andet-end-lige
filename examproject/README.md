    - Overview of the project

In this project, we solve the three problems from the Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis exam for 2023.

The notebook is divided into three sections, one for each problem. The py-file is also divided into three different sections, with one section for each problem. Each section thus contains the classes and functions to solve the appertaining problem.


The **results** of the project can be seen from running [examproject.ipynb](examproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
