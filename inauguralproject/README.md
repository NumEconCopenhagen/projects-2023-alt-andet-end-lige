    - Overview of the project

In this project, we numerically solve the model from the assignment "Time Use of Couples". The project explores the division of labor in the home and in the market between males and females and how this work division impacts the aggregate utility of the household.


The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
