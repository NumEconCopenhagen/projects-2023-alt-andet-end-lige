# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Comparison of Results from the Principal-Agent Model with and without Education as signaling** and is about solving the principal agent model with adverse selection. We examine this solution under different parameter values. Later we extent the model with education as signaling, so that the pricipal can screen the workers and set different contracts based on years of education. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
